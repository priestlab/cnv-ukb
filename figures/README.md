# Manuscript Figures and Tables

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used to make figures and data tables. Each main figure in the manuscript corresponds to one notebook, and one file in the `output` directory. 

Tables (for main text and supplement) all pertain to the [constraint](https://github.com/priestlab/cnv-ukb/tree/master/constraint) analysis, and were grouped into one notebook, whose output directs to the `tables` directory.  

The `supplement` directory is akin to this one in structure, and contains figures and tables pertaining to the supplement. It also contains the full table of supplementary data pertaining to the constraint analysis.

## Extras:
- `cytoBand.txt.gz` is a dependency for the Figure1 notebook, where regional density of CNV is computed.
- `helvetica.tff` is used throughout the figure notebooks as a font depencency.

_Note:_ some main figure notebooks also make related supplementary figures. For example, the Figure 1 notebook (Population CNV burden) outputs Figure-S1 (CNV density normalized by marker count).
